# Overview

This design document describes the design of the MXNet system and deep learning libraries in general. Deep learning practitioners and builders of other deep learning systems can use these system design notes to understand the  strategy, benefits, and drawbacks of our design choices. 

# Deep Learning System Design Concepts

This section describes general design concepts of deep learning systems. It focuses on the following three factors that influence the design and architecture of a deep learning system:


- Abstraction
2. Optimization
3. Trade offs
